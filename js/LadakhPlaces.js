		"Description": "Embark on a journey-the Chadar Trek-to be blessed by the experience of a lifetime. This because, it primarily involves walking along a river of ice, the frozen river of Zanskar accords to it the name of the frozen sheet or the Chadar trek. Becoming thus a sheet of ice the Zanskaris have used the ice-path as a major trade-route for centuries. If walking on glass, atop centuries of water frozen beneath your feet interests you then the Chadar Trek is the right deal to break this holiday season. Seated at an altitude of 3850 mts/12628 ft the Chadar trek will sure give you goosebumps and memories to last a lifetime."
